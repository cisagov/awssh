This project provides a tool that simplifies secure shell connections over
[AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)
(formerly known as SSM).

## Pre-requisites ##

- The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your system.
- A valid AWS profile that has permissions to start/stop SSM sessions.
- A [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell.

## Usage ##

### Setup ###

1. Install the `awssh` command line utility.  One easy way to do this is
   to run the `setup-env` script in the main directory.
1. Define environment variables:
   - `AWSSH_PROFILE_FILTER`: A string that will match one or more profiles
     in your AWS configuration file that have permission to start/stop SSM
     sessions.
   - `AWSSH_USER`: The username to use for ssh connections over SSM.

    ```bash
    export AWSSH_PROFILE_FILTER="startstopssmsession"
    export AWSSH_USER="lemmy.kilmister"
    ```

1. Source the [`awssh-completion.bash`](tools/awssh-completion.bash) file in
   your `bash` environment:

   ```bash
   source tools/awssh-completion.bash
   ```

   If you skip this step, you won't get to enjoy any of that sweet, sweet
   tab completion that will make life a lot easier for you.  Don't say we
   didn't warn you.

### Start a SSM shell session without ssh ###

```console
awssh --no-ssh my-aws-startstopssmsession-profile i-01234567890abcdef
```

### Start a SSM shell session with ssh ###

```console
awssh my-aws-startstopssmsession-profile i-01234567890abcdef
```

Tab completion can be used to autocomplete the following items as you type
your `awssh` command:

- Shared credentials file (following `-c`, `--credentials=FILENAME`), by
  showing matching files in the `.aws` directory in your home directory
  (e.g. `~/.aws/`)
- AWS region (`-r`, `--region`)
- AWS profile (`<profile>`), provided your chosen (or default) credentials
  file contains at least one profile that matches the string specified by the
  `AWSSH_PROFILE_FILTER` environment variable
- AWS instance you want to open a session to (`<instance-id>`); note that
  if your instance is tagged with a name, you can start typing that name and
  when you tab complete, the name will be transformed into the instance ID
  (assuming you have typed enough of the name to identify a unique instance).
